## week 1

Group formed. I linked GitHub accounts with zID in classroom and joined into the project created by the team. As scrum master, I organised the GitHub structure. I wrote three user story for initialising proposal and project development and the PDS for basic product introduction. Meanwhile, together with teammates, we watched tutorial videos of related concepts(CI/CD, TDD,DF) and discussed the direction of project.


## week 2

As the proposal needs a lot of refining, I spent the week mainly on rewriting the proposal. The main function of the application has been changed. Meanwhile, I held a meeting every two days, and pushed team members to contribute into the proposal and the project.


## week 3

Dialogflow needs more explanation as the team members feel confused during the work of this week. As a result, I read the dialogflow documents and Google dialogflow API v2 documents.


## week 4

Implement google API encapsulation with the base API implement. Digging possibilities from the current architecture to make the project works more efficient. Also reading related documents of Restful API call to help improving the API implement.


## week 5

Adding another course (COMP9311) into dialogflow. The process of trainning DF is not what we expected. Directions might need to be changed. Encountered a problem about OAuth and the problem is solved. 


## week 6

Structure another knowledge base. Adding multiple FAQ sources for COMP9021. Changing the intent input context and output context. Discuss with teammates about if it is essential to add ML function inside the current project. 

## week 7 

The idea of adding another machine learning module still stays unsolved after 2 meetings. Keeping pushing the frontend UI, scrapping data from lecture notes.

## week 8
Helping structuring machine learning module with teammates. Scrapping more data from both lecture notes and given data by lecturer. A lot of data cleaning work. Handed the data to teammates and let them finish the machine learning training.

## week 9
Prepared for the presenatation/demo. Created and refined some user scenarios that can be used on the presentation. Tons of Debugging.

## week 10
Finish the report.

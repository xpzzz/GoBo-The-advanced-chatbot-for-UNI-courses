## week 1

Group formed. I linked GitHub accounts with zID in classroom and joined into the project created by the team. As scrum master, I organised the GitHub structure. I wrote three user story for initialising proposal and project development and the PDS for basic product introduction. Meanwhile, together with teammates, we watched tutorial videos of related concepts(CI/CD, TDD,DF) and discussed the direction of project.


## week 2

As the proposal needs a lot of refining, I spent the week mainly on rewriting the proposal. The main function of the application has been changed. Meanwhile, I held a meeting every two days, and pushed team members to contribute into the proposal and the project.


## week 3

Dialogflow needs more explanation as the team members feel confused during the work of this week. As a result, I read the dialogflow documents and Google dialogflow API v2 documents.


## week 4
Implement google API encapsulation with the base API implement. Digging possibilities from the current architecture to make the project works more efficient.

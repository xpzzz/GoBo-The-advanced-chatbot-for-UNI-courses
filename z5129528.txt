## week 1

Group formed. I linked GitHub accounts with zID in classroom and joined into the project created by the team. As scrum master, I organised the GitHub structure. I wrote three user story for initialising proposal and project development and the PDS for basic product introduction. Meanwhile, together with teammates, we watched tutorial videos of related concepts(CI/CD, TDD,DF) and discussed the direction of project.

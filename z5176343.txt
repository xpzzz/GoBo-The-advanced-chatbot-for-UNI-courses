Week 1

Group formed. I initialised the Github repo and created several branches for my team (frontend, design, df-playground). We discussed with the tech-stack that we are going to use and the good practices to follow (TDD, feature-branch). Together with Yifan, we initialised the React app for our frontend. We are waiting for the maintainer role to be added to our team so that we can add CI integrations into our repo for further development.

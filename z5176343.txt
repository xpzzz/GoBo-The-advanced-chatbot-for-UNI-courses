Week 1

Group formed. I initialised the Github repo and created several branches for my team (frontend, design, df-playground). We discussed with the tech-stack that we are going to use and the good practices to follow (TDD, feature-branch). Together with Yifan, we initialised the React app for our frontend. We are waiting for the maintainer role to be added to our team so that we can add CI integrations into our repo for further development.

Week 2

We re-designed our tech architecture and decided the critical points for our proposal. I drew the architecture diagram and wrote the tech paragraph in the proposal. Besides, we started to learn about DialogFlow. I set up the CircleCI pipeline for the project.

Week 3

I set up the Pivotal Web Service for our deployment. Together with Yifan, I added the Dialogflow Web Demo to our frontend and deployed online. After that, I added configuration in CircleCI to automate frontend test, build and deployment.

Week 4

Instead of DialogFlow's Web Demo, we decided to build our frontend. According to our original architectural design, we wanted our frontend to communicate with DialogFlow directly. To achieve that, I built up the /auth API in our backend with Wenxiao and Minjie, and the logic layer in our frontend. Then I did the integration test and adjusted our CI configuration to deploy the backend server. I also set up the Messenger webhook to trigger our bot from Messenger.

###week1
Group formed. I linked GitHub accounts with zID in classroom and joined into the project created by the team. I wrote a user story for initialising proposal and project development. Meanwhile, together with teammates, we watched teaching video of related concepts(CI/CD, TDD,DF) and discussed the direction of project.


###week2
I got involved in the discussion of epics of the project. I figured out the workflow of dialogflow and assisted our master with the proprosal. I learned how to use dialogflow to create an chatbot agent and use python to call its api. I will continue to learn how to apply it to our project.

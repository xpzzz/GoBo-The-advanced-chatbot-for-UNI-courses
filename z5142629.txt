###week1
Group formed. I linked GitHub accounts with zID in classroom and joined into the project created by the team. I wrote a user story for initialising proposal and project development. Meanwhile, together with teammates, we watched teaching video of related concepts(CI/CD, TDD,DF) and discussed the direction of project.


###week2
I got involved in the discussion of epics of the project. I figured out the workflow of dialogflow and assisted our master with the proprosal. I learned how to use dialogflow to create an chatbot agent and use python to call its api. I will continue to learn how to apply it to our project.


###week3
The object course has been decided. I assisted scrum master with proposal and gave own advice to revise it. I created our initial agent on dialogflow and took the test to construst its response rule.I continue reading the documents and api instruction of Dialogflow and tried to communicate with Dialogflow by python.


###week4
I wrote the yaml file with swagger and used swagger-codegen to construct the framework of backend api. And wrote document_implement and knowledge base_implement as tools for managing the knowledge base content on Dialogflow. Together with teammate, we figured out the authurisation method used to get jwt token for frontend.

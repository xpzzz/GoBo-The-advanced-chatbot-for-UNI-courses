Group formed. I linked GitHub accounts with zID in classroom and joined into the project created by the team. I wrote a user story for initialising proposal and project development. Meanwhile, together with teammates, we watched teaching video of related concepts(CI/CD, TDD,DF) and discussed the direction of project.

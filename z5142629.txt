# Work Diary

## Name: Wenxiao Xu
## zID: z5142629

### week1
Group formed. I linked GitHub accounts with zID in classroom and joined into the project created by the team. I wrote a user story for initialising proposal and project development. Meanwhile, together with teammates, we watched teaching video of related concepts(CI/CD, TDD,DF) and discussed the direction of project.


### week2
I got involved in the discussion of epics of the project. I figured out the workflow of dialogflow and assisted our master with the proprosal. I learned how to use dialogflow to create an chatbot agent and use python to call its api. I will continue to learn how to apply it to our project.


### week3
The object course has been decided. I assisted scrum master with proposal and gave own advice to revise it. I created our initial agent on dialogflow and took the test to construst its response rule.I continue reading the documents and api instruction of Dialogflow and tried to communicate with Dialogflow by python.


### week4
I wrote the yaml file with swagger and used swagger-codegen to construct the framework of backend api. And wrote document_implement and knowledge base_implement as tools for managing the knowledge base content on Dialogflow. Together with teammate, we figured out the authurisation method used to get jwt token for frontend. 

### week5
We changed the workflow and decided to use backend to communicate with dialogflow so that I migrated the communication part to backend and constructed the corresponding functions to take parameters from and get dialogflow's responses back to frontend. I rewrote the swagger file and refined the df implement file. 

### week6
I refined the interacting logic in the function by keeping course name as the context in order to promise the better understanding of user's utterance and read more documents about how to improve the performance of DF.

### week7
I used word2vec to generate the model and the vectors of the word vocabulary for matching similar questions with the user query. Meanwhile, tried to tune the better appropriate threshold out between the confidence of dialogflow recognition and the most similarity coefficient of our own model generated. Then, as the machine learning part designed ready, I will read more documents to find an appropriate method of classifying the user query into two classes, one is for forum and another is for resources in textbook.

### week8
I refined the word2vec function and made it cacheable. I wrote the manager for chatbot to decide which result should be return, and connected CNN part and other codes on the backend together. Based on the teammate's code, regenerated the format of data to fit the corresponding method and decorated the pattern and prefix for output returned to users.

### week9
Fixed some bugs and prepared for the presentation. Discussed with team members for presentation procedure and distribution. Prepared scenarios and test cases for the live demo part.

### week10
Helped team leader to complete and refine the report.

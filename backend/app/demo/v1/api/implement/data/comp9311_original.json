{"question": "Really need Help to improve this ER diagram!This is the first version of my myphotos.net. Thanks to Rui Mu, Yuhao Qi and Siyang Huang, without whom I cannot conclude the relationship between entities properly.However, there are still some problems that need to be fixed, that's why I seek help in our forum.First of all, we have a disagreement on the role contacts play in our ER diagram. I insist that we do not really have to generate a unique id for every contract which may lead to redundancy, and this is the reason that the contact entity does not inherit from person entity.Second, users in our system could reply to each other's comments over and over again. Although I use posted time instead of posted date as well as an author as the primary key of comments, I am still confused about if I should generate a unique (random or combined with other meaningful attributes) for every comment.Third, as we can see in our assignment description, serval users can add photos in one exactly 'public' photo collection. How can this be presented in our ER diagram? Should we add an additional relationship between the user entity and photo collection?Finally, if you find some mistake among entities, relations, or attributes, plz post here.Thank you all very much.

I sure contact is a weak entity because contacts arecompletely managed by users and don't many sense without users.The other thing that I'm not 100% about is that the person entity has email address as a key which would be inherited bythe weak contact entity.

{"question": "Dear Professor Hamadi,I have some questions about your assignment. I had discussed them with one of our tutors and figured out some, but there was still a bit left that had to bother you.1st, How can we name a trinary relationship? I.e. the relationship among photo, user, and tags. Should we use formal named rules printed on our assignment description, e.g photos_have_tags_by_users or just users_tag_photos? I do think the latter could be better as it's shorter and never miss any key information, although it disobeys the formal grammar.2nd, I notice that Collection entity is total participation in the inheritance relationship, which means when we insert a Collection instance, we have to check whether it is a User_Collection or a Group_Collection. So whether we need to implement a trigger to imply this process, or the only thing we should do is to never insert into Collection without inserting into its child class?3rd, I also notice that some 1:n relationship cannot be mapped as a passive form, i.e 'Key' relation between photos and collections, and some n:m relationship is in noun form, i.e. 'member' relationship between users and groups. Do the formal named rules still work here, e.g users_member_groups? Or we could choose whatever that is meaningful, like users_in_groups?Hope to receive your feedback!Best wishes,Xin Li", "answer": ["https://webcms3.cse.unsw.edu.au/COMP9311/18s2/forums/2701965", 1]}

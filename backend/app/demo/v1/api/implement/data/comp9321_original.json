Should we write other APIs that retrieve a list of order by status (such as paid but not processed, or processed but not paid, or not paid and not processed, or paid and processed)?I think it makes sense that the barista would like to check which orders are not yet processed to avoid making drinks for the same order repeatedly. This is the only scene I can think about in which someone would like to get orders by status. The cashier would only check processing status and payment status (for a particular order, not all orders in some status) when amending or cancelling an order, and the barista would only check payment status (for a particular order, not all orders in some status) before releasing the drink for the order. So why are there only two orders available as open orders in case 3? Does the barista only process orders that are paid?

Maybe you just need a separate way of checking this then? Think about this.An order can be cancelled (I told you under what condition this could happen)An order can be released (this status is decided by the barista, and will be allowed only after payment is checked)For 'released orders' to be 'deleted' from the list is fine. But of course, this doesn't mean it is deleted from the resources collection.Maybe I can further clarify about the workflows depicted in the spec:The main point here is the coffee order resource is being \u2018worked on\u2019 by two processes and each process can individually update an order (the same order). The API design should be aware of the possibility that, barista can pick up an order, and the payment can be made by the customer.

If cashier just create a payment, so who will update the payment information?
